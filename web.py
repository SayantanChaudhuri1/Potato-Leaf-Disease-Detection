    This system uses a machine learning model to detect plant diseases in potato crops. 
    By uploading an image of a potato plant's leaf, the system will predict whether the plant is healthy or affected by a disease.
    
    The goal of this project is to assist farmers in identifying diseases early and taking preventive measures, thereby 
    ensuring better crop yield and promoting sustainable agriculture practices.

    ### How It Works:
    1. Upload an image of a potato plant.
    2. The model will predict whether itâ€™s healthy or affected by a disease.
    3. The result will help you make informed decisions about plant care.
    
    ### Supported Diseases:
    - Early Blight
    - Late Blight
    - Healthy Plant

    ### Let's start by uploading an image in the 'Disease Recognition' page.
